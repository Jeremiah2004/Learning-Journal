I started working on my game "Easier Said Than Run", a 2D platform game geared towards a surviving in a hectic, fast-paced environment. The aim of the game is to keep the running character away from the objects that come flying out at him. The further your character goes, the quicker the character would speed up and the score would increase with your distance. I wanted to model my game off the no internet dinosaur game but with some notable aesthetic differences. 
The first of the four tutorials I decided to write up was the scene setting tutorial; a document that would detail my construction and loading of a scene suitable for a 2D platformer game to be played on the Unity games engine. As mentioned within the tutorial, I installed the latest version of Unity and initially used the 2D platformer game to enable me to learn on the go. Once, I'd ordered the prefabs and opened the script in Visual Studio 2022, I could consider the scene adequate for editing and constructing. After gaining a foundational understanding, I started out on the 2D core module of Unity where nothing was already placed and started to put my own touch on things. I downloaded a free asset pack which contained a sprite which I thought I'd be able to use as my main character. After undergoing some difficulties with implementing it, I made my own and imported it onto the face of the original tile I'd used as a placeholder.

The second of the four tutorials I decided to write up was the character movement tutorial, which I would document as created the program where the sprite could move forwards and backwards. This was done by me engaging in scripting for the first time. After attaching the script to the character, I created a class  


The third of the four tutorials I decided to make was the character animation tutorial, something I thought would help people following in my footsteps to help flip the character when advancing in the opposite direction and for there to be some movement in the legs when walking and/or running in general. This was achieved by learning and applying usage of the animation tool and animator component within the Unity tool. I created a sequence of sprite stances for thr running and jumping and triggered them by an if statement that would detect whether or not it was time to put the animation in effect.
